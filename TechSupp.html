              /whois [user] — (e.g., /whois iCCup.x64)
              Searches for basic information about the user, including the date of their last appearance on the server and current location if they are online.
              Alternative versions of this command: /where /whereis
              /whoami — (e.g., /whoami)
              Displays information about you on Battle.net.</textarea>
        
          
            <textarea id="ls" onclick="tech('ls')" class="helpt ls"> 
              /w [user] — (e.g., /w iCCup.x64)
              Sends a private message to a user who is online, regardless of whether they are on the same channel as you or any other channel. This command allows you to inform your friend that you are online.
              Alternative versions of this command: /m /msg /whisper
            
              /r [text] — (e.g., /r Want to go for a smoke?)
              Sends a private message to the last user who sent you a private message and is online, regardless of whether they are on the same channel as you or any other channel.
              Alternative versions of this command: /reply</textarea>

              /ignore [user] — (e.g., /ignore iCCup.x64)
              Ignores all future messages from this user. If the behavior of a user seems offensive or their replies are distracting, use this command. All further statements from this user will not bother you.
              Alternative versions of this command: /squelch  </textarea>
            
            
            <textarea id="unignore" onclick="tech('unignore')" class="helpt">   
              /unignore [user] — (e.g., /unignore iCCup.x64)

              /dnd [text] — (e.g., /dnd Sorry, I'm playing with iCCup.x64)
                "Do Not Disturb" — prevents all private messages from appearing on your screen. In essence, this command is similar to /away. This mode does not allow other users to send you private messages while you are in a game. However, you can still see all regular messages on the general channel. To turn off the DND mode, simply type /dnd without adding any text.

              /stats [user] — (e.g., /stats iCCup.x64)
              Shows the score and rank report for DotA players. When used without a parameter, it displays your statistics; when used in a game, it shows the statistics of all players present in that game.</textarea>

[spoiler=Solution Option 2]
Disable DEP for the entire system.
To do this, click "Start," in the "Search programs and files" field, type cmd. A program shortcut will appear at the top of the window. Right-click on it and select "Run as administrator."
[img]https://i.imgur.com/1Sj61RV.png[/img]
A command prompt window will appear. Add the following line:
[b]bcdedit.exe /set {current} nx AlwaysOff[/b]
Press Enter.
[img]https://i.imgur.com/c0ewUli.png[/img]
Once you see the message "The operation completed successfully" in the command prompt window, close the window and restart your computer to apply the changes. This method allows you to disable DEP for all services or programs.
[b][i]You can re-enable it using the command [b]bcdedit.exe /set {current} nx OptIn[/b][/i].

You can also try disabling DEP only for Warcraft 3. This may help as well.
 
Find the "Computer" icon on your desktop (if you can't find it, click "Start" and look to the right of the window), right-click on it, and select "Properties." This will open a window with basic information about your computer. In its left part, there's a small menu, and what interests us is the "Advanced system settings" option. Click it.

A new window opens. On the "Advanced" tab, click the "Settings" button.

Another window will open. On it, select the "Data Execution Prevention" tab. Check the box next to "Turn on DEP for all programs and services except those I select," and use the "Add" button to add program files (.exe) that need to be disabled.

Don't forget to click the OK button when you've finished your selection.

Another similar method, but using the registry editor. Open the registry editor (WIN+R, type regedit in the window, and press Enter). Navigate to HKEY LOCAL MACHINE — SOFTWARE — Microsoft — Windows NT — CurrentVersion — AppCompatFlags — Layers. If there's no Layers entry, create it yourself. Then, create a string value in it, name it as the path to the program's executable file, and set DisableNXShowUI as its value.

I strongly advise against using this registry editor method to avoid making unintended changes to the registry. You assume responsibility for performing this action.

Additionally, [conduct a trace](http://www.iccup.com/away/c3dc32fea8b7e045fe0b12bb04945bcf/) and send the results here in a ticket. This might help resolve the issue.

<h1>You broke it! Crash info will be sent to our developers</h1>

<textarea id="crash4">Hello

[spoiler=Solution Option 1:]
[b]1.[/b] Open "Run" through the "Start" menu or by pressing Win + X (for Windows 8 users).

[b]2.[/b] Type [b]wusa.exe /uninstall /kb:2859537[/b] in the command line.

[b]3.[/b] Restart your PC if the system finds and removes this update and check if the error 0xc0000005 has disappeared. If the update wasn't found, continue to enter the command [b]wusa.exe /uninstall /kb:(update number)[/b]. The update numbers should be [b]2859537, 2872339, 2882822, and 971033[/b]. The order can be changed; it doesn't matter. Advice: after each update removal, restart your PC and check if the 0xc0000005 error has disappeared.
[/spoiler]

[spoiler=Solution Option 2:]
As mentioned at the very beginning, there can be many reasons for the 0xc0000005 startup error. If the instructions above didn't help you, we recommend doing the following.

[b]1)[/b] Test your RAM. You can use the free Memtest utility. Run it and scan your RAM for errors. The 0xc0000005 error may be related to improper DDR operation.

[b]2)[/b] If your RAM is fine, the next step is to scan your system for viruses and other malware. Remove all suspicious files and programs (especially adware). In other words, clean up your system. Then restart your PC and check if the 0xc0000005 error persists.

[b]3)[/b] In rare cases, the 0xc0000005 startup error may be caused by conflicts with video card drivers. Update them or, if you're already using the latest drivers, roll them back to a previous version.

[b]4)[/b] We also recommend trying to update printer drivers; conflicts with them can sometimes cause the error. As a last resort, uninstall the drivers or create a clean profile through the printer settings.

Finally, if the issue persists, restore your system to an earlier state, particularly to a point in time when you were absolutely certain that the 0xc0000005 startup error didn't exist.
[/spoiler]

[spoiler=Other Ways to Resolve]
This error can occur for various reasons, so there are multiple ways to resolve it.

[b]1)[/b] The simplest way is to restart your computer. If that doesn't work, proceed to the next step.

[b]2)[/b]

[b]a)[/b] Uninstall Warcraft and the launcher.
[b]b)[/b] Then, clean the registry:

[b]3)[/b] Add the game to the firewall and antivirus exception list and disable DEP.

[b]4)[/b] Connection is not to our server. You need to open the launcher folder and delete bngates.dat. Perform the operation several times.

[b]5)[/b] Issues with Custom Maps. Solution: enable OpenGL in the launcher. Also, disable User Account Control (UAC) at your own risk. Launch WarCraft III in windowed mode (check in the launcher).

  <textarea id="could">Hello.
First, read everything, then proceed with the solution as instructed. This error only occurs if the program is being blocked from outside. The issue might be with the firewall or antivirus. You need to disable these programs and [url=https://iccup.com/dota/files.html][b]reinstall the launcher[/b]. 
  
Disabling the firewall:
Control Panel >> All Control Panel Items (small icons) >> Firewall >> Turn Windows Firewall on or off.
If you have Comodo or Avira antivirus installed on your computer, you should remove them entirely. They do not provide the necessary protection against malicious software. We recommend using Dr.Web, Norton, or Windows Defender.
  
Disabling your antivirus is done through the program's settings. For more detailed information, check your product's website.
  
Reinstalling WarCraft III:
Uninstall WarCraft III
Control Panel >> All Control Panel Items >> Programs and Features, then find and uninstall WarCraft III.
Install [url=https://iccup.com/dota/community/thread/783730.html][b]WarCraft III[/b].[/url]
  
[b]Additionally, this problem is often resolved by simply restarting your router or computer.

  <h1>5. That account does not exist/Учётной записи с таким именем не существует</h1>

  <textarea id="myInput29">Hello. To install Windows using VMware Fusion on your M1 Mac, you need to do the following:
  [spoiler=Screenshot][img]https://i.imgur.com/5pHZgrx.png[/img][/spoiler]
  For some reason, the VMware website doesn't open on mobile devices.

  [url=http://www.iccup.com/away/e7aec0810c3d97ee873687c949e0cec8/]Download from the official site[/url] VMware universal file for installing VMware Fusion Technology Preview 22H2, which is suitable for both Apple and Intel processors.
  Download the [url=http://www.iccup.com/away/f363bb97176124ca5367e0210f49d978/]installation file of the ARM version of Windows[/url] to your computer.
  Access to the Microsoft website is restricted in Russia, so use a VPN.
  Install VMware Fusion on your computer.
  After installation, run the program, click on the "+" and select "New."
  In the window that appears, select "Install from disc or image."
  Drag the downloaded Windows image into the window.
  Set a password to log in, and choose the level of integration of the two operating systems that suits you.
  Click "Finish" and wait for Windows to finish installing.
  After these simple steps, the system will be ready to work, and you can install the software you need on it. Please note that VMware Fusion supports two levels of system integration:

  More Seamless — where folders and files from one system are visible in the other.
  More Isolated — where both systems exist in their own separate spaces, and files from one system are not visible in the other.
  Choose the option that suits you better. When using Parallels, I applied the "More Seamless" option. In this case, it is very convenient to download something on macOS and then start Windows and open the necessary file there.

    <h1>Opening Ports for Game Creation</h1>

    <textarea id="port">Hello.
        [spoiler=Introduction]
        Remember: You must turn off the [color=red]Firewall[/color] (Windows Firewall) before creating your maps, or else the port for Warcraft III will be blocked by the system and your port will not open. If you don't want to disable the [color=red]Firewall[/color], you can go another way:

        Open the "Windows Firewall" component. To do this, click the Start button [URL=http://www.iccup.com/away/4fca64a3b04137a7ce9eee6875aba15e/][IMG]http://s017.radikal.ru/i420/1210/a5/96d964cc6000.jpg[/IMG][/URL] and select Control Panel. In the search field, enter "firewall" and then click "Windows Firewall."

        In the left area, select [color=green]Advanced settings[/color]. If you see a request to enter the administrator's password or confirmation, enter the password or provide confirmation.

        In the Windows Firewall dialog box in elevated security mode, in the left area, click on "Inbound Rules," and then in the right area, click "New Rule." Here, you need to enter the necessary port ([color=green]6112, 6119[/color]).

        Follow the instructions [URL=http://www.iccup.com/away/4fca64a3b04137a7ce9eee6875aba15e/][IMG]http://s017.radikal.ru/i420/1210/a5/96d964cc6000.jpg[/IMG][/URL] for creating a new inbound rule.</spoiler>

        [spoiler=#1]
        This method will allow you to easily open port [color=green]6112[/color] (Warcraft's port) and host games. Exit the game and close "iCCup Launcher" from the task list. Next, open your browser and enter either [url=http://www.iccup.com/away/6c9c9379c0f1ed4ad6d2efb1ff041f62/]192.168.0.1[/url] or [url=http://www.iccup.com/away/fff57ce593f2abbebb468d32f24c5171/]192.168.1.1[/url] - this is the "brain" of your router, which controls ports. When the link is opened, you'll see 2 fields for login and password, which are needed to access the modem's settings, which by default control the ports of your IP address. Depending on the router model, you may be redirected to this link:

        [img]http://mirskoy.ru/files/img/mt880_nat/1.png[/img]

        Here, enter your router's login and password. After entering the username and password, you'll arrive at the main menu of modem settings. After entering the web interface menu, find the "Port Forwarding" section. Once this menu is open, you'll need to enter some parameters. The list of parameter values that may be required: [color=red]Start Port[/color] - 6112, [color=red]End Port[/color] - 6119. If done correctly, the [color=green]port is open[/color].</spoiler>

        [spoiler=#2]
        If you have the money or don't want to open ports manually, this method is for you. Usually, a [color=green]static[/color] IP address is set by your provider. Dial your provider's number to get this service, but first, find out whether you have a [color=red]dynamic[/color] or [color=green]static[/color] IP. If you have a [color=red]dynamic[/color] IP (often, providers don't give you a static address by default), ask for a [color=green]static[/color] (external IP) address service.

        Typically, this service costs around 100-150 rubles per month. With this, you can create maps on iCCup without any router settings.[/spoiler]

        [spoiler=#3]
        If you do have a [color=green]static[/color] IP address, but ports aren't opening or you can't create a game, this method is for you. Start by comparing the IP addresses on the website [url=http://www.iccup.com/away/4fb8152fbc5355de229ea2f393d19020/]2ip.ru[/url] and in Start -> Run -> CMD (command prompt) -> Press ENTER -> type "ipconfig."

        [URL=http://www.iccup.com/away/4fca64a3b04137a7ce9eee6875aba15e/][IMG]http://s019.radikal.ru/i628/1210/6b/91cc31139367.jpg[/IMG][/URL]

        If the IP addresses don't match, it means you don't have a [color=green]static[/color] IP address, and simple game hosting is impossible. To open ports, usually, you need to turn off all firewalls. To disable Windows Firewall, go to Start -> Control Panel -> Network Connections -> Properties -> Advanced -> Settings -> [color=red]Disable[/color].

        In very rare cases, your provider may have blocked ports for you, including the Warcraft III port ([color=green]6112 - 6119[/color]). Often, it's enough to call customer support or send them an email, and everything will be sorted out. Perhaps you chose a tariff plan that limits your possibilities. Much depends on the settings of your ADSL modem and router, but that's a separate topic.

        If you have Outpost, you can see which port connections are being established in incoming connections. If you see a connection, your provider is allowing it, and you either need to turn off the firewall or allow [color=green]War3.exe[/color] to connect to the network. If not, there's a small chance to host a game in a local network and try to connect to the game or have someone try the command in Start -> CMD (command prompt) -> telnet 79.164.41.171 6112. If it shows a black screen, the [color=green]port is open[/color]. If it shows "[color=red]Failed to open a connection to this node on port 6112: Connection Failed[/color]", it means the [color=red]port is closed[/color], or you didn't host the game and exited it.</spoiler>

        A relatively simple method to [color=green]open port[/color] 6112 if you don't have a [color=green]static IP address[/color], but it requires a separate program (torrent). Turn off [color=red]Firewall/antivirus/other software[/color] related to the router beforehand.

    <h1>Tracing</h1>
    <textarea id="tras">Hello.
        [b]1) Domain Tracing[/b]
        To do this, you'll need to use two built-in Windows OS utilities: ping and tracert.

        So, press the [b]Win+R[/b] key combination on your keyboard or open [b]Start -> Run[/b]. In the window that appears, type [b]cmd[/b]:

        [img]https://s01.geekpic.net/dt-70QWKQ.png[/img]

        The Windows command prompt should open. To perform a ping, you need to enter the command [b]ping site.com[/b], where site.com is the name of your domain. In this case, it's iccup.com.

        [img]https://s01.geekpic.net/dt-6URA8S.png[/img]

        [b]2) After entering, press Enter and wait for the command to complete.[/b]

        Now you need to copy the result you've obtained. To do this, right-click within the console area, and from the context menu, choose "Mark."

        [img]https://s01.geekpic.net/dt-437WLY.png[/img]

        [img]https://s01.geekpic.net/dt-5GCDLQ.png[/img]

        [b]3) After that, use your mouse to select the necessary text area and press Enter. Now the result is saved to the clipboard, and you can paste it wherever you need, for example, send it to the technical support staff (Ctrl + V).[/b]

        To perform a tracert, you need to enter the command [b]tracert iccup.com[/b] instead of the ping command. Then press Enter, wait for it to complete, and copy the result in the same way and send it to us in the ticket.

        [img]https://s01.geekpic.net/dt-YEEBE7.png[/img>

        Variant with a program!

        Hello. To begin with, you need to perform tracing.
        Please download this program: [url=https://cloud.mail.ru/public/312442a3449b/iCCup.Trace.Utility.exe][b]iCCup.Trace.Utility[/b][/url]
        Run it and wait for the tracing to complete.
        After that, a folder [b]iCCup.Trace[/b] will appear on your [color=blue][b]C:/[/b][/color] drive.
        You need to [b]archive it and upload it to any file-sharing service[/b], then send the link here in the ticket.

    <h1>Admins Taking a Long Time to Respond</h1>
    <textarea id="supp">Hello.
        All your complaints will be thoroughly reviewed. If your complaint is taking more than 3 days to process, it's likely because there are a lot of complaints in the queue. All complaints are processed in the order they are received. All complaints will be reviewed without fail.
        If your complaint is taking too long to process, don't worry. The administration is obligated to close the ticket before the end of the season, and the violator will be penalized regardless. If the ticket is reviewed at the very end of the season, the violator's punishment is postponed to the new season.
        So, patience is the key.
        We will punish everyone who deserves it!
        P.S. If you reply to the complaint again, it will be pushed to the end of the queue, just like a newly created one. So, we do not recommend replying to the complaint until you receive a response.

Also, you should check your computer for viruses. To clean the system, use the program [url=https://adwcleaner.ru.uptodown.com/windows]adwcleaner[/url]. In Warcraft itself, you need to delete files with the extensions [color=red].mix[/color] and [color=red].mixtipe[/color]. It's advisable to completely reinstall Warcraft and install a proper, complete WarCraft 3 like this [url=http://rutor.info/torrent/229806/warcraft-3-the-reign-of-chaos-2002-2003-pc-repack-ot-r.g-mehaniki].</textarea>

    <textarea type="text" id="a56">Hello. This error indicates that something is interfering with the proper functioning of Warcraft. It could be viruses, hacks, third-party programs, malicious software, and so on. The solution to this problem is to check your computer for viruses using the program [url=http://www.iccup.com/away/ec653b58424d04c31af986809fee68cd/]adwcleaner[/url], remove all third-party programs that may be related to Warcraft and the launcher. Even your antivirus may be blocking the game's functionality, so (after checking for viruses), you should run the game without it or add the game and launcher folder to the antivirus exceptions in the settings. You should also reinstall the [url=http://iccup.com/files.html]launcher[/url] and [url=http://www.iccup.com/away/27ca60ea1337307fedecb77026222bf9/]Warcraft[/url]. Disable any third-party programs that are running (e.g., uTorrent or vk.saver). You can check them in the system tray (Start menu, the far right of the screen, before the clock).

        No List of Bots (Expanded Answer)
    
    
    
    <textarea type="text" id="83map2">
        [b]Hello.[/b]
        The map creation system has changed for the better for players. Now maps [b]6.83s[/b] or [b]iCCup Dota[/b] are not tied to specific bots. [b]You can now create either of these maps on any bot you like.[/b] The game creation command remains the same; the difference is in the mod name. This change allows you to create both the new and old versions on the same bot. Here's how to create both on the same bot.
